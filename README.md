What is this purpose of this Git repository?

This repo contains all the work done throughout the Comp 20 semester that holds the multiple labs 
done throughout the semester along with assignments.

What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?

My favorite assignment for this semester was the group assignment. One was able to use the multiple 
things one has learned throughout the semester and put it all in one single package. We also learned 
about the need to be able to work with others and settle what a person needs to do. And my favorite
thing about this assignment was the need to look and google for answer, not everything one will
know will be taught by the proffessor and it's required of us to seek an answer.

How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?

I have grown a lot throughout this semester, I have learned a new sense of interest for the web.
Not only have I discovered an interest for the web but also to come out and to be a better 
programmer over all.

What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Cite two examples as evidence.

One is something I learned really soon based on my Assignment 4 and that was to not take the 
small things for granted and to make sure one is commited to everything one works on. You may
know everything about programming but your write up may be completely horrible, as one can 
see from my multiple misspellings and errors on my write up. A second 
thing I learned, which comes with Assignment 4 and the heavy emphasis from Ming was ensuring
one has an understanding of security when it comes to building websites, one should
never trust what the user inputs and should at least have some understanding of how
one can mess with what they build. This can be seen from the writes up by our partners 
on our code and how they can easily be manipulated and exploited.

Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?

I would like to delve more deeply into not only Web Design but also Web Dev. I enjoyed 
a lot designing websites and contributed a lot to my group assignment's styling I hope
I can become better not only in the front-end side of a Website but also the Back-End.
