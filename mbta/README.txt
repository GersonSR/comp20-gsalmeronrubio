Assignment 2: Closest MBTA Station

October 20th, 2016

Implemented
--------------------------------
I was able to create an MBTA page that displays a
Google Map covering the whole browser window. On this 
Map, there are markers which show the location of the different
stops on the red line, all connected by a red polyline. There is
also another polyline connecting the point in which someone is located
to the closest stop. When clicking on the marker it will display, if you click
on the you are here marker, it will display the closest station and
how far away in miles is the closest stop. On clicking a stop marker
it will display the name, and if there are any trains coming they 
will be shown and how long it will take to arrive, in seconds, to the
stop.

Acknowledgments 
--------------------------------
Most of the help recieved was from Jeremy Su along with the 
provided examples from class, such as the provided examples from the AJAX 
set and how to access a JSON file, along with the Google Maps set to see
how to initialize a Google Map API. I also took a look at links provided in the specs
such as the data on using the JSON information for the Red Line. 
I also took a look at Google Maps API documentation on how to succesfully manipulate 
different Map objects and functions.
Other Information was taken from Stack Overflow, such as how to use the Haversine Formula in 
Javascript: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14560999/using-the-haversine-formula-in-javascript.
