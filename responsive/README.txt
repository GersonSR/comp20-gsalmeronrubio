Implemented
--------------------------------
A homer.jpg file was manipulated to show
the four different sprites from the single image
depending on the width of the browser. At a width greater
than 1200, it shows the top left image. At a width greater
than 800 and less than or equal to 1200 is showed the top left
image. At a width greater than 400px and less than an equal to
a width size of 800 show the lower left image.  At a width of less
than or equal to 400 it showed the bottom right image. 

Acknowledgments 
--------------------------------
Most of the help received was from Piazza posts, especially the one
about Chrome Web Dev tools showing the width of the browser window.
