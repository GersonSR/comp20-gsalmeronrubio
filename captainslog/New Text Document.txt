Implemented
--------------------------------
I fully implimented the ability to enter a 
statment and to be saved client-side using 
local storage. The key for each statement entered
is the time in UTC format, in the GMT Time Zone.
Since it saves the statements in local storage,
when the client returns, the previous statement are
printed, with the latest one printed first.


Acknowledgments 
--------------------------------
Most of the help was taken from the JQuery examples
in the Comp 20 examples.

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9756120/how-do-i-get-a-utc-timestamp-in-javascript
This two links along with other inputs allowed me for checking when the client pressed enter
along with getting the correct time format.

Time Spent
