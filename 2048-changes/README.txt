Implemented
--------------------------------
I was able to impliment all 3 parts of the required 
assigment and HTTP requests. I was able to
write the POST /submit.json in which 
provided an object with a score, username, and
grid are provide my server takes these variables and 
adds a time variable. GET /scores.json returns 
a long JSON array with the every score object stored
in the database corresponding with the provided
query ?username=username. An empty array is returned
if no username is found or there is no query string.
At last is a simple GET / page that returns 
one single variable with all the HTML, displaying 
all the scores in descending order. More CSS and JS for 
specific page to be added possibly in the future.
