Implemented
--------------------------------
Using Javascript, I was able to impliment movie quotes on a short clip
that would appear appropietly depending on the time on the media, which in
this case was the short clip from a classic movie. Simple CSS
was added to edit and ease the view of the page and the 
movie quotes.

Acknowledgments 
--------------------------------
Most of the help recieved was from Jeremy Su along with the 
provided examples from class and the double rainbow example.
I also searched on Stack Overflow how to center a video.

Time Spent
--------------------------------
3 Hours
