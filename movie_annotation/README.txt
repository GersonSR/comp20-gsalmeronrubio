Lab: Movie Annotation
Gerson Salmeron Rubio 
October 12th, 2016

Implemented
--------------------------------
An index.html file was created which contains the content
of a video and a div that holds the text that would be the
annotation for the video. Th implimented tags follow the timing
of when the characters say them in the video, JavaScript was
used to create this based on the time of the video. Simple CSS
was added to edit and ease the view of the page and the 
movie quotes.

Acknowledgments 
--------------------------------
Most of the help recieved was from Jeremy Su along with the 
provided examples from class and the double rainbow example.
I also searched on Stack Overflow how to center a video.

Time Spent
